                  I was born in Taipei, Taiwan and moved into the Southern California in 1st grade. Though my official first name is "Yi Ju", I usually go by "Rita". Since I am in "engineering-undeclared", I am interested in exploring the various fields of engineering and computer science. Math and science classes have always been my favorite subjects. Rather unsurprisingly, I am involved in my high school's Math Club and Science Olympiad team as the president for both.

                  I have lived in Elk Grove, California for nearly my entire life. I was admitted into Berkeley’s College of Engineering as an EECS major. In high school, I was involved in Mathletes, Science Olympiad, and Art Club. Painting is my favorite pastime and my preferred medium is watercolor. (If Computer Science doesn’t work out for me, I’ll probably become a starving artist.)

I’m an EECS major and have always planned on being one since I was eleven and had taken a liking to the funny-looking triangular brackets when programming in HTML. Besides fiddling around with source codes and creating multi-coloured marquee scrolls, my other loves are Harry Potter, writing, books - especially hardbound ones with cracking spines- , photography, blogging, animals and dogs in particular, the smell of coffee, sunny days and dessert.

                  Hi everyone! My name is Ashleigh and I'm Filipino-American, born and raised in the Philippines. I attended an international school for thirteen years, and now I'm in the College of Letters and Science as an intended Computer Science major. I've been obsessed with computers and coding from a very young age (Neopets!), and since then it's become my dream to work for a company like Google or Blizzard (I'm a complete World of Warcraft geek). I'm also very interested in artificial intelligence, so it's likely that I'll add a double major in Cognitive Science.

                  My family calls me "hey you!" but everyone else just calls me "Deirdre" though some people have gotten a lot more creative than that. Although I was born in Manila, Philippines I'm a San Diegan at heart. My love for puzzles and mysteries developed my interests in math while this increasingly digital age has pleasantly pushed me into learning more about computers. As of now, I'm currently in the Letters and Science shooting for Business Administration at Haas but if that doesn't work out I'm planning on advancing my interests in Math.

                  Hello! I am from Victorville, California. I am excited for Berkeley and the CS kickstart program because it will be an entire different perspective for me since I live in the High Desert. I have a strong passion for anything related to computers. I have taken several computer courses in my high school and community college and it is one subject I can study for life. I have no experience in programming, but I am eager to learn. One of my hobbies include making videos by using Sony Vegas Pro 8.0. My intended major is computer science in the Letters & Sciences College.

Since I was young, I have been moving from places to places within China, and later I went to Singapore and attended school there. In my sophomore year of high school, I moved to Mission Viejo, a suburb in Orange County, California. I am currently a computer science major, but I am interested in studying economics as well. In my leisure time, I enjoy reading novels, listening to music, and playing a variety of percussion instruments.

                  MSE theater-loving math nerd from Elk Grove, California. I know nothing about computer science but those who do say I'd love it, so I'll give it a go. Making stuff is what I like to do, after all - mostly stuffed animals for my friends, but I'll do anything productive. CS sounds pretty productive to me, anyway. Singing is also a hobby. Maybe try and get used to that. Oh, and I love to run.

Although Taiwan is a leading hardware supplier in the competitive 3C industry, I am more interested in the software and applications of innovative technology products. Maybe I can be a bridge between hardware and software, the East and the West, after sharpening my CS knowledge and skills. Innovation and software is the key value embedded in any hardware product. I believe the KickStart will give me a good start for my university life. As for myself, I play piano and cello, enjoy travelling and reading.

I plan to major in mechanical engineering because I love math and physics, especially mechanics. I'm also interested in biology, so I hope to focus my career in that direction in the future. In high school, I was involved in marching band, FBLA, and various community service clubs, and I played piano outside of school. In my free time, I'm typically at the library reading new novels or watching Korean dramas with my friends!

I was admitted into the College of Letters and Sciences, where I plan to take a variety of classes in the sciences, math, and art.  In high school I played the flute in both wind ensemble and orchestra, and I was on the swim team and in stage crew at our school's auditorium.

I applied as an MCB major, but plan to switch to either Chemical Engineering or Bioengineering by the start of my 2nd year. My interest in general engineering acted as a phenomenal impact in my decision to apply to CS KickStart. I wanted to explore the different opportunities given by engineering, and found that even in the subject I consider my "home," bioengineering, I still need CS skills to fully grasp the multidisciplinary concepts.

                    Hi! I'm Ingrid from Arcadia, California but originally from Taiwan. I am going to enter the College of Letters and Science in the fall and I intend to major in Computer Science. I have never really had much experience with CS but it has always been a fascinating subject to me. One day, I would like to use the inspiration of the seemingly improbably ideas found in science fiction, which I am a fan of, and transform it to reality - except the robots taking over the world part of course.

                    Hi there! My name is Anne Jilliane, but you can call me Jill. I was born in the Philippines and moved to California when I was 8. I have an identical twin sister, whose name has a two-letter difference from mine. She is also in this program. I am eager to learn, explore, and gain new experiences. Right now, I am considering going into the business field, but I am open and very excited to try new things. I do not know much about computer science, but I am excited to delve into a world that has countless possibilities!

Having never lived outside of a five mile radius from Cupertino, I'd say that my interest in pursuing a career in technology isn't much of a coincidence; I've always been around and fascinated by technology! I come with some technological knowhow (from courses during my first couple years of high school), but certainly hope  to build on it during CS Kickstart! Aside from that, I enjoy doodling, reading, gardening, high five-ing, and consuming chocolate. I'm excited to meet you all soon!

                    I was born and raised in Elk Grove, California my entire life. Currently, I am undeclared in the College of Letters and Science with an interest in computer programming. I'm hoping to explore this field more in depth before declaring a major in CS. In high school, I was involved in Mathletes, MESA, and JNHS. In my free time, I enjoy reading fiction novels, listening to K-pop, and watching romantic comedies. I am incredibly nerdy and I love video games, even though I tend to shriek when monsters appear and attack. I am super excited for Cal and I can't wait to meet you all!

Born and raised in San Diego, I moved to the Marin/San Francisco area in 1st grade and have been living here ever since. My intended major is economics/pre-business, but I am open to exploring my other academic interests for a second major or minor. I am also interested in studying languages and I plan on continuing to learn Spanish so that I can study abroad in Spain one day.

In short, I think if I study computer science, I can meld the two fields together to create my own unique experience at Berkeley, and I believe this program can help me take a step in the right direction.

                I'm from Santa Barbara, California, and I’m going to be a coming into Berkeley this year as a Bioengineering major. Compsci has always been a curiosity for me- I played around with Lego NXT Mindstorms when I helped mentor a FLL team, I’ve tried a few online programming tutorials, and I took AP Compsci this year for fun because I wanted to learn more. However, I've never really had the chance to fully learn a programming language, and I hope to take as many programming classes as I can to see if I'd like to possibly major/minor in compsci.
                Some cool things about me: This year, I was on First Robotics Team 1717 and helped design a mechanism that collected Frisbees off the floor for our robot, which was incredibly fun! Also, in my free time, I absolutely love being outdoors - rollerblading, rock climbing, and tennis being just a few of my favorite past times.

                Hello fellow Bears! My name is Hailey Gordon, and I am from the lovely town of Bakersfield, CA (about two hours away from LA). Sadly, I have not seen or met any movie stars despite my close proximity to Hollywood. I am more than excited to join the CS Kickstart program so I can meet other students interested in the world of computers! Some things you should know about me: my little brother is one my favorite people in the world, you can always find a camera within a 1 foot radius of me because I absolutely love taking pictures, and I will most likely wilt away if I don't have Rootbeer at least once a day. Aside from being a picky eater(I don't like sweets, yes that includes chocolate) I'm easy to get along with as long as you don't mind my crazy energy! Can't wait to meet you all.

I've just gotten into CS this summer and have been trying to learn Python. I like that there are many different ways to get to a common answer, but there is always that one clever way to achieve it, or clever ways... For me, computer science is such a versatile skill that can be useful in every major and I want to understand how to use it with confidence. I will be in the College of Letters and Science this coming fall studying Applied Math with a focus on Computer Science. Well, that's the plan at least :)

My interest in CS started last year while I was at a summer camp when my friends learned how to program and to create their own video games. I was born in Singapore, moved to Canada and lived there for 5 years (no I actually don't end my sentences with eh! Surprising eh?) before moving to Fremont, CA where I currently live. I love to eat food, watch tv, travel, nap, and to take pictures.

                  Hi everyone, I am Anne-Ting from Taipei, Taiwan. I have been moving back and forth between Taiwan and Japan during my childhood. I spent my past four years in Tokyo where I attended an international school. I'm currently undeclared in the College of Letters & Science with an interest in pre-health. But I love to explore new things so I'm certainly open to other fields of study. Although I have very limited knowledge in programming I've always liked math so I look forward to explore and learn about Computer Science, and hopefully this program will help me discover a new interest. In my spare time I love to go running, swimming, do community service, read novels and watch TV shows. I can't wait to meet everyone at CS KickStart!

                  Hello! My name is Angela and I was born and raised in a suburb east of downtown Los Angeles named Monterey Park. I will be a Electrical Engineering and Computer Science major in the fall because I love physics and math. I am interested in CS because I enjoy creative problem solving and it has so many wonderful applications! In high school, I was involved in choir (show and classical), Math Club, CSF, NHS, United Sciences, and Student Advocates for Voter Empowerment. In my free time, I like playing board games, reading, cooking, singing, hiking, and taking photos.

                  Hello! I was born in San Diego, California, but I spent five years living in Korea before moving back to SD to attend middle school and high school. At school, I was involved in track and field and I started a new chapter of DECA. I intend to major in either computer science or cognitive science. Originally, I thought I was heading towards the business field until I fell in love with CS in my computer science class just my senior year. My hobby is utilizing the wonders of the Adobe programs to design graphics and layouts, and I spend most of my time interning at a newspaper company and being the art director of a magazine. I hope to explore the fields of computer graphics, UI design, and human-computer interaction in more depth. I am so excited for August to come around!

                  Hello, world! I’m from Los Altos, a cute and inexplicably sidewalk-less town about an hour southwest of Berkeley. I’m majoring in EECS in the College of Engineering this fall. I don’t have much programming experience, but I look forward to exploring the amazing possibilities of computers at CS KickStart so I can someday help design the next “game-changing” machines that revolutionize the way we think and live. I love baking, running, eating Nutella and Sriracha sauce (not at the same time!), balancing stuff on my head, and caterpillars, who are incredibly wise. I look forward to meeting all of you this August!

                  I have lived in the SF Bay Area all my life and could not be happier to continue living in such an amazing and cultured environment for the next four years. I plan to major in Applied Mathematics at Cal, but I recently became very interested in Computer Science after one of my best friends introduced me to the world of programming. While at UC Berkeley, I also hope that I can continue dancing. Ballet has been a passion of mine for 13 years and I almost declined college to pursue a professional career in dance. Yet after meeting some truly intelligent and enthusiastic people at UC Berkeley I knew that this is where I wanted to be. Hopefully the knowledge I gain through the Kickstart program will help me succeed in my CS classes at Cal and potentially lead me to become a CS major!

                  Hello! My name is Alanna and I come from Milpitas, CA, which is between San Jose and Fremont in the South Bay. I am an incoming EECS major with no programming experience at all, but I would love to learn about computer science through CS Kickstart! Although I enjoy math and the physical sciences a lot, I also have a deep passion for history, centered more on U.S. History. My hobbies include reading almost anything, painting with acrylic paint, watching TV and movies, and spending time with my younger brother. In high school, the activity I enjoyed the most was tutoring people in math. It is something that I plan to continue doing up at Cal! I look forward to having a great time at CS Kickstart and meeting other Cal Bears!

                  Hey everyone! I’m Amanda and I’m from North Reading, Massachusetts, a tiny little town north of Boston. I’ve spent my entire life in the North Reading but I’ve always wanted to move to California, so I’m really excited to attend UC Berkeley. I will be in the College of Letters & Sciences as an intended computer science major this fall. I don’t have much programming experience besides an introductory programming class I took in high school last year, but math has always been my favorite subject so hopefully that’s a start. And as for a little bit more about myself, I love music, coffee mugs, exploring new places, painting birdhouses, otters, dorky jokes, and playing tennis. I’m so appreciative of the opportunity that this program presents and I’m really excited to join the CS KickStart team!

                  I was born and raised in Iran but went to high school in Dubai. Ever since I was 13 I was fascinated by different areas of computer science especially artificial intelligence, because in Computer Science there is always room for growth. There is no limit to what you can do and where you can get to and that is what captured my interest. I am never able to put down a programming problem until I find the solution to it.
                  Although computer science is the source of my fascination, I have many diverse interests. I began playing the piano at the age of 7.I play sports such as badminton and swimming from quite early in my life. One of my favorite hobbies is watching movies from different genres and different countries. I love meeting people from new countries and cultures so this program is a great opportunity for me to pursue my passion and meet people who share this passion with me.

                  Hello, my name is Tanya and I am an upcoming EECS major. In high school, I was an active part of my school's orchestra and badminton team. I also sang Indian Classical Music, was part of an exchange program through which I went to Japan, and taught math in Kumon. I have always been interested in computers, so I decided to enter this field, but I ultimately hope to be a woman pioneer in the tech industry. Through this program, I hope to meet other CS/EECS majors and form a bond that will last my college years and more.

I love meeting new people and having interesting discussions so feel free to chat any time! I'll be an Engineering Physics major--if you know any other freshmen women in this major, please let me know (too much testosterone now...)! Other than copying and pasting code for an Arduino project in school, this will be my only CS experience so far, but I'm definitely excited! I love music, movies, tennis, leisurely hikes, and amusement parks. Somethings cool about me..hmmm...well this is kind of nerdy but I create really quirky mnemonic devices and love constitutional law (go Mock Trial pre-trial!). Can't wait to meet all of you :D

I'm looking into CS because I know how versatile it is. My interests are incredibly broad so I wanted to explore a subject that could potentially flow into all of the things I'm curious about, things which include space, the environment, filmmaking, art, and biology.

I'm super excited to be attending CS Kickstart and meeting other girls interested in the field of computer science especially at my number one dream school, UC Berkeley! At first I was scared of going into computer science because of my lack of experience in programming, but I knew that my interest in software engineering should overcome my fear. 
                  Some little things about me are that I'm very social. My favorite color is mint and my favorite TV shows are The Office, Parks and Rec, Greek, and Modern Family. I love to play volleyball and occasionally tennis, and I'm planning on starting yoga once I get to college. One interesting thing about me is probably that I have the biggest appetite known to mankind, which is a blessing and a curse. 
                  All in all, I am so excited to start off my college experience with a program like CS Kickstart!

                  Hey everyone! I'm an EECS major from Morgan Hill, CA, which is just south of San Jose. I enjoy playing softball, watching Netflix, listening to music (anything from Ed Sheeran to twenty one pilots to The Strokes) and going to Giants games! I've always been interested in computer science but never had the opportunity to learn more about it, which makes all of this so much more exciting. I'm really looking forward to meeting new people and experiencing all Berkeley has to offer!

                  Hi! My name is Sabrina Fathi, and I'm from Casablanca, Morocco. I spent my senior year studying abroad in Massachusetts, and I cannot express how excited I am to be spending the next four years far from New England snowstorms. As you can tell, I'm not a winter person, and coming from a country where the Mediterranean climate keeps you warm all year round, I've always indulged in outdoor activities such as paddle boarding, horseback riding (You can always find me riding at the barn near my house), and playing tennis. I'm really interested in CS because I truly find it fascinating, and I see myself always pushing the limits of technology when I've graduated. I'm pretty much glued to my computer half the time, programming a bit, and watching one of the many, many TV shows I'm addicted to.

                  Hello! I’m from Santa Clarita, a suburb north of Los Angeles. I’m an intended Computer Science and Psychology major. Computers and the Internet helped me branch out from a shy and timid child, and I hope my contributions to computer science aid in inspiring a new generation of children. In addition, I love that the field is versatile and that I can incorporate it with my interests, which include psychology, baking, community service and design. I also enjoy exploring, ice skating, being environmentally friendly, and watching documentaries! I look forward to getting to know about everyone’s goals and ambitions, and to participate in this wonderful program!

                  Hey guys, I'm Alice from the beautiful Monterey Bay, California. I'm aiming for an L&S CS major but I don't have much experience in computers or coding except for a few self-learning attempts and HTML/CSS from Tumblr so I'm thankful for any help I get! I enjoy math/logic problem solving and hopefully computer science will be a possible future career. Some things about me? I love animals, especially cats, I got 2 of them at home. I am an avid listener of all genres of music from Kpop to alternative rock. I love playing video games.. like League of Legends and watching anime.. shamelessly it almost becomes a lifestyle. When I'm not glued to the computer screen, I play piano for fun or go for a run or swim. I am really excited to attend Cal and meet all of you this Fall!

                  I'm from Cupertino, California (Yup, Apple Headquarters) and hope to major in Computer Science or Applied Mathematics at Cal. Although I’ve been painting for as long as I can remember, I recently started playing around with 3-D modeling and graphics softwares such as Autodesk Maya and Blender. Seeing their applications intersect with what I’ve learned in calculus, physics, and Java first sparked my interest in computer science, especially computer graphics. I also play the violin, am a big fan of Thai food, and love climbing onto my roof to look at stars. I'm so excited to start my freshman year with CS Kickstart—I've heard lots of great things about the program and can't wait to meet everyone!

                  I am from Santa Barbara, a small beach town on the California coast, and will be attending Berkeley as an Electrical Engineering and Computer Science major. EECS is such a new field and I am excited by the possibilities of where it could go. I have been playing piano since I was four, so it’s safe to say music has been a huge part of my life, whether it be classical music (my favorite period is the Romantic Period) or modern music (Vampire Weekend, AWOLNATION, and Lily Allen are some of my favorite artists). In high school, I became engrossed in mock trial, and I hope to continue mock trial at Berkeley. I love rollercoasters, frozen yogurt, and going to the beach.

You’ll often find me coming up with (semi-bad) puns, watching Ellen videos on YouTube, and racing in Mario Kart as the coolest driver Yoshi. I’ve been doing Chinese dance since first grade and hope to continue dancing in college (for fun). Regarding academics, I’ll be in UC Berkeley’s College of Letters & Science, where I’m excited to learn new things. Recently I’ve become particularly interested in Computer Science, as it seems to offer endless possibilities for creating things that help our world or are just awesome. I don’t have much Computer Science experience, so hopefully I can learn more about the field and develop some programming skills at CS KickStart. Overall, I’m excited to attend the program and look forward to meeting you all! Go Bears!

In 2012, I participated in a summer cryptography program at Stanford University. There, I had my first brush with proofs and coding. I walked out of the program knowing that I needed to learn Java or Python ASAP. In these coming years, I hope to study Applied Mathematics and/or Computer Science. I spend my free time sketching portraits, fangirling over Harry Potter, and fighting oppressive social structures.

I have no experience with computer programming, but I am psyched to participate in CS KickStart. I use Google and my phone apps everyday without understanding how they were created. I want to understand programming and computers overall through CS KickStart. I love to read manga, watch criminal shows and cartoons, listen to dubstep, doodle, bake sweets, and eat.

I just recently became interested in CS because I realized how much bigger the world becomes when you have access to computer knowledge. I'm planning to major in Computer Science in the College of Letters and Sciences. Along with the many hours of studying Berkeley will surely require, in my free time, I plan on continuing my passion for bhangra, a Punjabi folk dance, playing badminton, sewing and fashion design. Something interesting about me, I guess, is that I'm exactly 5 ft tall, so I like to wear really high heels to make up for my height! The only experience I have with CS is the few lessons I took on codecademy.com so I'm looking forward to everything the CS Kickstart program has to offer!

Coming from San Gabriel in SoCal, my main interests were in the arts and languages, right until I took one Web Programing class that ignited my interest in CS. It wasn't until now however that I have really gotten the chance to pursue that interest. As the first in my family to go to college its difficult to take a deep breath and plunge into fields that for one, I haven't had much experience in, but mainly, don't quite resonate as they aren't predominately women or much less hispanic. I hope at CS Kickstart I will find that solidifying realization that CS is definitely for me and that I will build a foundation that will keep me a strong CS contender in my years at Cal.

                  Hi! I'm Tracy. I'm from Fremont, California and I am an EECS major. I became interested in computer science after I attended a video game design summer program four years ago. Although my experience in programming is very limited, I am excited to be explore my interests through kickstart and learn more about the field of computer science! In my spare time, I like to visit new places and try out new restaurants. I also love to sing, travel, and meet new people. I look forward to meeting everyone this fall!

                  Hi! I'm Jenny and I hail from sunny San Diego, California. I'm beyond excited to enter Cal this fall as an EECS major as I've always been enamored with technology and how it impacts our society. With the endless possibilities that come with computer science, I hope to continue expanding my programming knowledge and build some awesome projects. Currently, I'm especially interested in augmented reality devices like Google Glass and their effect on the way we interact with each other and the world around us. In addition to communicating in the language of computers, I also love writing and storytelling in all forms of media, from music to graphic design to film. I'm eager to explore the artistic as well as the technical side of CS and can't wait to see what Cal has to offer. Go Bears!

                  Hi, my name is Ivette Flores and I come from a small school in Inglewood, California. I've lived in Southern California my whole life and have an aversion to the cold. I'm not 100% on my major, but I'm leaning very strongly towards CS. My hobbies include watching Teen Wolf, spending way too much time on tumblr, reading, and playing tennis.

                <p>
                  Hello everyone! My name is Melody, and I am from San Jose, CA. I have always considered myself a STEM girl ever since I started playing Internet games (e.g. Club Penguin and Neopets) when I was little. From then on, I continued to develop my interests in math and technology throughout middle and high school. During senior year, I took an introductory computer science class, which sparked my interest in programming and designing software. Although I only have limited experience with HTML/CSS and JavaScript, I can’t wait to expand my CS knowledge at UC Berkeley, starting with CS KickStart. Outside of STEM, I was very active in Key Club, a community service organization, and I would love to continue volunteering throughout college. I also live up to my name, since I enjoy playing piano and participating in my church’s youth choir.

                  Hi everyone! I'm from Fremont, California, and I’m going to be a coming into Berkeley this year as a EECS major. I don’t have much programming experience but I’ve always thought that computer science would be an introduction into an exciting and abstract way of reasoning. In high school, I’ve been actively involved in Speech and Debate and DECA, which is a business and marketing club. I’m interested in public policy as well, especially the intersection of government and science as it pertains to national security. At Berkeley, I hope to join the Ultimate Frisbee team and audition for the Mock Trial team. Some of my favorite TV shows include Psych, The West Wing, and House of Cards. I’m incredibly excited to be starting off my Berkeley experience with KickStart!

                <p>
                  Hi! My name is Deborah, and I’m from the San Francisco Bay Area. I will be in the College of Letters & Science this fall, where I plan to major in Cognitive Science, and possibly double major in Computer Science. 
                  Computer science interests me because of its versatility—how it can be used in so many different fields. I hope that by gaining computer science skills I will have the ability to work in and explore many different subjects and disciplines.
                  My other interests include reading (especially novels, manga, and news articles), human geography, learning new languages, playing piano, singing, watching movies (particularly espionage movies), and cooking.
                  I’m really excited for CS Kickstart and UC Berkeley, and I look forward to meeting everyone!

                  Mavey (MAY-vee), 17 years old. Born within San Jose, raised by San Francisco, China, New Zealand, Oakland, San Leandro, Salinas, and now expanding my horizons at Berkeley. Some life goals include making Computer Psychology a “real” major, joining the Google team, and studying abroad in outer space.

                  Would you believe me if I told you I was more excited when I learned about CS Kickstart than I was when I received my UC Berkeley acceptance letter?

                  Computer science is like martial arts and poetry; self-defense and self-expression. I feel like a superhero in training to save the world, acquiring the ability to defend myself and others in the technological universe. I think my fondness of poetry enhances my curiosity for coding. They are cousins in writing, requiring muse, creativity, and overcoming writer’s block. As a wordsmith of both worlds, it makes me happy to practice an art form I enjoy.

                  Hello, my name is Karen. I'm from Bakersfield, CA.   I am EECS major with some interest in double majoring applied mathematics. I am intrigued by computer science because I believe how computer works somehow correlates to how the world works.  Plus I like the title "Hacker" (not I want to be involved in  privacy infiltrating, Hacker just sound cool).  I read more about computer history than work on programming.  I play video games, watch cartoons/anime (Avatar TLA,FMA Brotherhood...), and I am a big fan of Chinese history/Wuxia Universe.

                  Hello lovely people! I am from a not so far off land called Murrieta, which is right in between San Diego and Los Angeles in SoCal. Currently I am in the College of Engineering, but I am undeclared so I am hoping CS Kickstart will provide me with some clarity. I also have no programming experience whatsoever, but I am ready to jump in head first. Some of my favorite things are cookie dough ice cream, long walks on the beach, and Led Zeppelin. I also play alto saxophone and have an undying love for Mock Trial. For now, I am just stoked to meet you all! Go Bears!

                  Since we can’t go through wormholes or black holes just yet, let’s build the future the realistic way, code by code. Excuse me, I’m “a little” obsessed with cosmology that kind of stuff: time travel, higher dimension, and multi-universe… Besides being a cosmo-worm, I also love dancing. Mainly ballet, but I also like hip-hop, jazz, and ballroom. I believe that the road to the future is paved by CS, that’s how important CS is. I might look quiet, but you can tell me if that’s how I really am once you get to know me.
