              <p>CS KickStart is a one-week introductory class to computer science. Students learn how to program, meet computer science students and professionals, and are introduced to different areas of computer science. This program targets incoming UC Berkeley students who are curious about computer science and are interested in math, science or engineering. Students do not need to have any prior skills in programming. Our goal is to give them a hands-on experience in programming and to show them the creativity and power of computer science.</p>

I'm obsessed with anything with sugar, Photoshop, anything to do with art (from DIYs to drawing portraits to makeup), reading through comments on controversial articles, and everything coffee-flavored.

                <p class="text-muted">Hi everyone! I'm Simin and I hail from Albuquerque, NM, home to America's darlings, High School Musical and Breaking Bad. I'm in Engineering Undeclared, but I'm confident that this program will provide me with some clarity about career paths. I got my first taste of CS at MIT's Women's Technology Program, where we had a crash course in Python. In particular, I'm motivated by the challenges of AI; among them is that actions which are intuitive to us require a vast amount of programming for a robot to replicate. It thrills me that programmers often examine things at the most deconstructed level and gain great insight into the world this way. In my spare time, I run for fun, worry about worrying too much, follow my neighbor's cat, read lots, draw, and do community service. My favorite television shows include Modern Family, iZombie, and Dance Moms (no shame). I'm eager for the program to begin and to meet you all!</p>

                <p class="text-muted">Hello, world! I'm an EECS major from San Jose, California. I was on the FRC robotics team at my high school for 4 years and I've dabbled in a few coding languages, ranging from Arduino to C# to Javascript. Beyond my studies, I'm working to be a social activist in STEM education; I spoke at the NAPE PDI Conference in Alexandria, VA, and the national PLTWSummit in Indianapolis on inequity in representation in STEM and the media. In the summers I help design programming curriculum to help encourage girls to become empowered and conscientious media developers. I almost always have my guitar with me, it's a old habit I picked up in the 8th grade. My favourite places to play are anywhere around people, and I've been told my sound edges on soulful and alternative rock. My major influences are the Districts, Billie Holiday, Bebel Giberto, Beruit, and Little Dragon.</p>

                <p class="text-muted">Hi, my name is Shaili and I am from Cupertino, California. I was admitted to Berkeley as computer science major. I don't have too much CS knowledge but my interest began last year when I took JAVA at my high school and attended a few local hackathons. I'd like to pursue computer science because it gives you the power to create so many different things that can be applied to any field of work. I like the idea of being able to create anything I want related to my interests. In terms of what I like, I love music and I'll listen to any type -- my music library is full of English, Spanish, Hindi, even some Arabic songs. I like to sing, play the piano, learn languages/word roots, write, play recreational sports, and play games (I'm kinda competitive when it comes to these). I'm really looking forward to CS kickstart and all I'm going to learn!</p>

I'll be in the College of Letters and Sciences in the fall, intending to major in either computer science or cognitive science. I became interested in CS just this past year and have been learning a little programming, but I'm looking forward to learning more about what CS can do. In my free time, I enjoy singing, playing and listening to music, running, reading, and watching horribly addicting reality TV shows. I'm excited to be a part of CS Kickstart this year!</p>
