              CS KickStart is a one week introductory course for incoming Berkeley women who are interested in math, science or engineering. Approximately 30 participants will come to Berkeley a week before the regular semester (08/16/2015-08/21/2015) to participate in a unique set of activities. Students will learn how to program, find out about the various domains of computer science and meet computer science students and professionals. We offer this program free of charge to students. Participants will be housed on campus and will experience computer science through a variety of activities including:
              <div style="padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;">
              <ul>
                <li><b>Programming Labs:</b>
                During the computer programming labs, students will acquire basic computer programming skills and work on a team project.</li>

                <li><b>What is Computer Science:</b>
                To develop students' understanding of computer science, we will host a series of talks from "How computer science is going to save the world" to one hour lectures about computer security, computer graphics, computer systems, computational biology and data management.</li>

                <li><b>Who are Computer Scientists:</b>
                Alumnae working in industry and academia will visit our program to talk to students about their job as a computer scientist.</li>

                <li><b>Life at Berkeley:</b>
                Formal information sessions as well as informal mentoring will allow participants to learn from current undergraduates about utilizing campus services and navigating within the computer science major and minor at Berkeley.</li>

                <li><b>Field Trip:</b>
                Students will visit a Silicon Valley company to explore an example work environment for a computer scientist.</li>
                
                <li><b>Social Activities:</b>
                In addition to the daily activities, students will participate in a number of social activities led by current undergraduates (e.g. ice cream social, game night) to create a network of students that together may promote a climate of inclusion within the EECS department.</li>

        <h2>NCWIT Grant</h2>
        <p>We are proud to announce that we were awarded the NCWIT Academic Alliance Seed Fund Grant sponsored by <a href = "http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft Research and the </a><a href = "https://www.ncwit.org/"> National Center for Women & Information Technology</a>. This $10,000 grant provides U.S. academic institutions with start-up funds to develop and implement initiatives that recruit and retain women in computing and technology fields of study. Since 2007, NCWIT and <a href = "http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft Research</a> have awarded $415,450 in funding to 34 universities and colleges over nine funding rounds. The NCWIT Academic Alliance Seed Fund will provide $10,000 each to the following five U.S. institutions: Auburn University: Computer Science for All Girls, Columbia University: The Artemis Project, Livingstone College: Bridge Program in Technology, Southern Illinois University: Android Development Camp for Middle School Girls, University of California at Berkeley: CS KickStart.</p>
        <h3>Women in STEM</h3>
        <p>Women currently earn more than half of all undergraduate degrees in the U.S., including 45% of math degrees and 38% of chemical engineering degrees, but nationwide they earn only 18% of computing and information sciences degrees. High school women account for 47% of all Advanced Placement (AP) Calculus test-takers, but only 19% of those who take the Computer Science AP test are women. At UC Berkeley, only 11.3% of EECS majors are female.</p>
        <h3>Goals of CS KickStart</h3>
        <p>CS KickStart builds upon the best practices in computer science education research to inspire, empower, inform, connect, and mentor women that may pursue computer science. This is achieved through a one week introductory class to computer science. Students learn how to program, meet computer science students and professionals, and are introduced to different areas of computer science. This program targets incoming students to UC Berkeley who are curious about computer science and are interested in math, science or engineering. Students do not need to have any prior skills in programming. Our goal is to give them a hands-on experience in programming and to show them the creativity and power of computer science.</p>
        <h3>About NCWIT</h3>
        <p>NCWIT is a national coalition of over 350 prominent corporations, academic institutions, government agencies, and non-profits working to increase the participation of women in technology and computing. NCWIT's work connects efforts to increase women's participation in technology along the entire pipeline, from K-12 and higher education through industry, academic, and entrepreneurial careers. The NCWIT Academic Alliance brings together more than 600 representatives from computer science and IT departments at colleges and universities across the country - spanning research universities, community colleges, women's colleges, and minority serving institutions - to work towards gender equity, diversity, and institutional change in computing higher education.

                      There are around 30 participants and 10 volunteers that come on the industry field trip. Due to limitations of traveling with a large group, in the past we have only visited companies located in San Francisco. Some suggested field trip activities include giving short office tours, giving informal employee presentations, and providing mingling time for employees and CS Kickstarters. But feel free to have fun with it! CS Kickstart can help you work out a field trip schedule and organize transportation to your offices.

First, double check that the date and times of the industry trip work for your company. Then, let us know about your interest and the location of your office, and we will get back to you when we have finalized our field trip location.
